### Overview
I created a train schedule application that incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data. My app retrieves and manipulates this information with Moment.js. This website provides up-to-date information about various trains, namely their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station.

-----
### Instructions
* When adding trains, administrators are able to submit the following:
		* Train Name
		* Destination 
		* First Train Time -- in military time
		* Frequency -- in minutes

	* Calculates when the next train will arrive; relative to current time

	* Users from many different machines are able to view same train times.
